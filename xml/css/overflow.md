# overflow

The`overflow`property specifies whether to clip content or to add scrollbars when the content of an element is too big to fit in a specified area.

The`overflow`property has the following values:

* `visible`
  * Default. The overflow is not clipped. It renders outside the element's box
* `hidden`
  * The overflow is clipped, and the rest of the content will be invisible
* `scroll`
  * The overflow is clipped, but a scrollbar is added to see the rest of the content
* `auto`
  * If overflow is clipped, a scrollbar should be added to see the rest of the content
